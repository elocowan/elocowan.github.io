A lot of the time I only see my values out of the corner of my eye, working away at the edges of my perception, influencing me from almost behind the scenes.
I know they shape my life, but I rarely perceive them clearly.

One thing that's been very useful to bring them out in the open is a values exercise suggested by Tasshin and Mary Bajorek in the Path to Empowerment. 
The first time I did it, within an hour my core values had come out of the shadows and were sitting around my kitchen table with me, having a nice friendly conversation.
My current core values are forgiveness, humor, simplicity, self-knowledge and fun.

I really liked how quick and easy the process was.
I already had my teenage step daughter try it, and I didnâ€™t get any pushback from her, which is a testament to how unassuming and smooth the process is.

When I first finished the values exercise and wanted to write something about each value, this is what came through:
>I seek resolution in my life through forgiveness. All my father figures had warm, dry senses of humor. Jeph Cowan, Dennis Leri, Steve Paxton, Feldenkrais. I enjoy living a simple life. The moments when I come to know myself in a deeper way make my life worth living. Self-knowledge and self-remembering re-expose me to my vow, the reason why I am here on earth, doing the things I do. When my life feels fun, I assume that means I am in contact with my purpose.
