For a long time, I only saw my values out of the corner of my eye, working away at the edges of my perception, influencing me from almost behind the scenes.
I knew they shaped my life, but I never perceived them clearly.
Then I found something very useful to bring them out in the open, a card sort values exercise suggested by Tasshin and Mary Bajorek in the Path to Empowerment, and within an hour my core values had come out of the shadows and were sitting around my kitchen table with me, having a nice friendly conversation.
Right now my core values are forgiveness, humor, simplicity, self-knowledge and fun.

I really liked how quick and easy the process was.
I already had my teenage step daughter try it, and I didnâ€™t get any pushback from her, which is a testament to how unassuming and smooth the process is.

When I first finished the values exercise and wanted to write something about each value, this is what came through:
>I seek resolution in my life through forgiveness. All my father figures had warm, dry senses of humor. Jeph Cowan, Dennis Leri, Steve Paxton, Feldenkrais. I enjoy living a simple life. The moments when I come to know myself in a deeper way make my life worth living. Self-knowledge and self-remembering re-expose me to my vow, the reason why I am here on earth, doing the things I do. When my life feels fun, I assume that means I am in contact with my purpose.
