In social media, my attention gets carried away in streams and feeds of posts. 
So here on my personal web_site_, I want information to accumulate in pages that come into being, live, connect and die over time. 
I want each page, while it exists, to stand unmoving but growing like a tree in a forest.

Foundations, not feeds.  
Pages, not posts.  
Trees, not trifles.
