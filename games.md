Do U want to play a game?

What are ur favorite games?

How do U know u're not playing a game?

Even tho I've only skimmed it, I love James Carse's book *Finite and Infinite Games*.
I love his distinctions.
Finite games play one way and infinite games play another.
Societies want certain things and cultures want others.

The fact that I love a book full of distinctions says something about what kinds of games I like to play.
