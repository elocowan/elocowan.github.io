Do U want to play a game?

What are ur favorite games?

How do U know u’re not playing a game?

Even tho I’ve only skimmed it, I love James Carse’s book _Finite and Infinite Games_. I love his distinctions. Finite games play one way and infinite games play another. Societies want certain things and cultures want others.

The fact that I love a book full of distinctions says something about what kinds of games I like to play.

[[tpot]] is a part of twitter that's a video game.

Types of Games: puzzles, cards, dice, video games, sports (team sports, races, judged competition), status (money), power (politics), sex, improvisation (music, dance, comedy)
