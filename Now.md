After moving my business site to [feldenpax.com](https://feldenpax.com), I'm building my personal site. 

This shift has something to do with longing:
- I want to level up my strategies, but I'm not sure what my goals are
- I want clearer goals
- I want to be more at peace with my relationship to money
- I want to develop an ethical practice to go along with my physical practices

I think maybe working on my personal website can help, but I'm not sure.
