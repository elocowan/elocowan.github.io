After moving my business site to [feldenpax.com](https://feldenpax.com/), I’m building my personal site.

This shift has something to do with longing:
- I want clearer goals
- I want to level up my strategies
- I want a better relationship with money
- I want to develop an ethical practice to go along with my physical practices

I think maybe working on my personal website can help, but I’m not sure.

I started with jekyll but then decided to use obsidian publish cause it's easier to deal with technical aspects.
