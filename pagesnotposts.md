In social media, information flows down streams and populates feeds in the form of posts.
But here on my personal web*site*, information accumulates in pages that come into being, live, connect and die over time.
This website has a life that reflects my life, and it sits here like a tree in a forest.

Foundations, not feeds.\
Pages, not posts.
