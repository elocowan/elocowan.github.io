In social media, my attention gets carried away in streams and feeds of posts.
So here on my personal web*site*, I want information to accumulate in pages that come into being, live, connect and die over time.
I want each page, while it exists, to stand unmoving but growing like a tree in a forest.

Roots, not rss.\
Foundations, not feeds.\
Pages, not posts.\
Trees, not trifles.
