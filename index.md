How do I introduce myself?

I seek resolution in my life through forgiveness.
All my father figures have had warm, dry senses of humor. 
Jeph Cowan, Dennis Leri, Steve Paxton, Feldenkrais.
I enjoy living a simple life.
The moments when I come to know myself in a deeper way make my life worth living.
Self-knowledge and self-remembering re-expose me to my vow, the reason why I am here on earth, doing the things I do.
When my life feels fun, I assume that means I am in contact with my purpose.

I like to stay focused on my values through various practices, so U could call me a practitioner.
I mostly focus on practicing my values through [Feldenkrais](/feldenkrais), Contact Improvisation, Journaling and Family.

This personal website is part of my quest.
